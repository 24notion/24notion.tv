                        We have had a very busy 2021! We crafted 2400+ campaigns that
                        drove significant impact, engagement and activations. We also
                        launched 372+ products and services, 1598+ event-based
                        experiential activations, 744 thought leadership engagements, and
                        garnered 324 million+ views/impressions per month. Lastly, we
                        achieved an impressive 325% return on investment (for our clients
                        *wink*)

                        24Notion is giving back to the local community as well as
                        supporting global communities – and this work landed us the #14
                        ranking in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) – Philanthropy by
                        the Portland Business Journal. We are so grateful for all of the
                        great work that 24Notion has been a part of in 2022.
